*For this project we had set up vue and had to make our own components inside of it. I did a button, the header and footer with specific styles. I actually somewhat understand vue now after my two 1 on 1's i had with Ashlyn and Jessica. 
*I struggled a bit with figuring out what goes in what folder as just adding header tags to one area doesnt do anything for the actual webpage because it all has to match up. After i had figured it out it was decelty less harder than before, i dont want o say easy because i know it will come back to bite me in the butt haha
* The stylings i had added arent that much but they are padding, color and font stylings.
